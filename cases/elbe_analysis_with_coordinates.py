#The purpose of this python file is an attempt to compute discharge values by coordinates. Instead of having a single discharge value for a basin,
#It would be much more valuable obtaining data of the discharge throughout the river. However, the problem arizes as the complexity of the problem
#exponentiates for the algorithm, which becomes extremely computationally expensive
